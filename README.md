# BikeRental

This project explores and models bike rental demand using the Bike Sharing Demand dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to predict hourly bike rental counts based on weather conditions, seasonal patterns, and temporal features.

The project focuses on exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling to understand what drives demand and to build accurate predictive models.
